 Within the library there are two forms of elliptic curve that are of interest. The first form is those defined over the prime field Fp. The elements of Fp are the integers 0 to p-1, where p is a prime number. This gives us a revised elliptic curve equation as follows:
 
 y^2 mod p = x^3 +ax + b mod p
 
 The second form is those defined over a binary field F2^m where the elements of the field are integers of length at most m bits. For this form the elliptic curve equation is modified to:
 
 y^2 + xy = x^3 + ax^2 + b (where b != 0)
